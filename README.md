# Library
 An extension of a 'Book' constructor to create a small library application
 
## To-Dos

- [x] Create a display for an array - myLibrary
- [x] New Book button - brings up a form/modal to add details of a book
- [x] On Submit, book should be added to myLibrary and displayed dynamically
- [ ] Book's Read status should be toggleable within its cell
- [ ] Add ability to delete book(s)
        - a checkbox to enable deletion of multiple at once with a delete button somewhere on the page?
        - a delete button in a cell?
- [ ] Store the library, and added books, in local storage
- [ ] 


## Issues

- [ ] Adding a book adds the current book and all others again.
