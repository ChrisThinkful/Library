# Library
An extension of a 'Book' constructor to create a small library application

[Live Demo](https://christhinkful.github.io/Library/)

## To-Dos

- [x] New Book button - brings up a form/modal to add details of a book
- [x] On Submit, book should be added to myLibrary
- [x] Create a display for an array - myLibrary
- [X] Book's Read status should be toggleable within its cell
- [x] Add ability to delete book(s)
        - a checkbox to enable deletion of multiple at once with a delete button somewhere on the page?
- [x] Store the library, and added books, in local storage


## Issues

- ~~When multiple books have been added, the "Read" button is no longer toggleable. I know that this is because I'm not querying ALL of the Read buttons, but when I do querySelectorAll('.read-button') and add an eventListener to each button, it breaks functionality. I will need to revisit this.~~


## What I learned/built upon

- I learned how to utilize object and object constructors
- I furthered my understanding of CSS grid
- I extended my comfortability with pseudo-classes
- More practice with DOM manipulation and dynamically created elements
- Introduction to setting and retrieving localStorage
